Asad Mehdi
Lab 7

Part 1
- Made my git repo, can be found here: https://github.com/asadmehdi785/websys

Part 2
- I drastically changed how my site looks with Bootstrap, and some jQuery UI. I now have 3 main pages: the homepage (index.html), a page listing all my labs (labs.html) and a page listing all my homework assignments (homework.html). 
- I also reorganized things so my CSS, JS, and XML files are all organized in their own folders.

Part 3
- I will be committing this README.txt and my final changes to github, and will also be sure to update the main README.md for the actual website.

Have a nice day! :)
