Description: This lab1 directory holds everything that I need to receive credit for the lab, for both parts 1 and 2.

The httpd-vhosts.conf file holds the code to define each virtual host for every directory.

The index.php file runs the phpinfo() script for lab1.

The phpinfo().pdf file is a PDF of what the aforementioned phpinfo() script displays.

The phpmyadmin.png file is a screenshot of my PHPMyAdmin dashboard.

Finally, the websys.png file is a screenshot of my entire websys directory.

Hope you have a nice day! :)
