Below are the commands I used for questions 7 - 10:

7. list all students' data in the following sequences;
	by rin,
	last name,
	RCSid,
	firstname

Code:

SELECT * FROM `students` ORDER BY 'rin' ASC
SELECT * FROM `students` ORDER BY 'last name' ASC
SELECT * FROM `students` ORDER BY 'rcsid' ASC
SELECT * FROM `students` ORDER BY 'first name' ASC

8. list all students first name and last name if their grade in any course was higher than a 90 (make sure at least one person fits the criterion

Code:

SELECT `students`.`first name`, `students`.`last name`, `grades`.`grade` FROM grades LEFT JOIN students ON students.rin = grades.rin LEFT JOIN courses ON grades.crn = courses.crn WHERE grades.grade > 90

9. list out the average grade in the second course

Code:

SELECT AVG(`grade`) FROM `grades` where `crn` = 38132

10. list out the number of students

Code:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students
