Name: Asad Mehdi

Doctype: I selected <!DOCTYPE HTML> (HTML5) mainly because I wanted to choose the most up-to-date HTML version. In addition, HTML5 is less strict than HTML 4.01, so validation was an easier and much quicker process.

Semantics: I think that the markup for my document is semantically correct. For my contact information, I used an unordered list to "list" out all of the information. I used a <h1> tag for my name, which I feel should be the first thing people see on my resume. I used a <h4> for my objective; I guess I also could have used an <h3> but for the purpose of this assignment I decided to use an <h4>. I used <div> tags for each of my sections (education, experience, etc), mainly for styling purposes. I also used <ul>s for listing out my accomplishments for my experiences.

hCard: The hCard information I added is useful to humans because they can quickly find my contact information based on its semantic relevance. For automated user agents, the hCard information was useful because they would be able to quickly find information that they need based on the class names (p-street-address, p-tel, etc.).
